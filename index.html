    <p>I wasn't born yesterday</p>
    <p>I think you're goddamn lyin'</p>
    <p>I wasn't born yesterday</p>
    <p>I think you're goddamn lyin'</p>
    <p>I wasn't born yesterday</p>
    <p>I wasn't born anyway</p>
    <p>I laughed when you went away</p>
    <p>I think you're goddamn lyin'</p>
  
    <p>You want her, you need her</p>
    <p>And yet, you don't believe her</p>
    <p>You want her, you need her</p>
    <p>And yet, you don't believe her</p>
    <p>You want her, you need her</p>
    <p>She no longer needs you, you, you</p>
    <p>You want her, you need her</p>
    <p>She no longer needs you, you, you</p>
       <p>You said I'm in a bettеr place</p>
    <p>I got a new birthday to celеbrate</p>

    <p>Those candles that you couldn't light</p>
    <p>You threw them out and you wondered why</p>
    <p>Don't know why I blew them out for me</p>
    <p>Until I forgot how to breathe</p>
    <p>I popped a vein and I made a wish</p>
    <p>I made a wish that'll never be</p>

    <p>Now I'm here, mm</p>
    <p>I've been in so many tears, I try my best not to count it</p>
    <p>I've been in so many hearts, I've been in so many prayers</p> 
    <p>I've been in so many couches</p>
    <p>I've been in so many lies, I've lived so many lives</p>
    <p>I've lived in so many houses</p>
    <p>I've been subject to change, I keep circlin' dates, I keep thinking about it</p>
    <p>
      Uh, I've been trying to unsee how you moved on from me
      'cause it feels like without me
    </p>

    <section>
          <p>I've been ripped from the floor, that umbilical cord is still sort of around me</p>
    <p>I wasn't born yesterday, mm</p>
    <p>I think you're goddamn lyin', mm</p>
    <p>I wasn't born yesterday, mm, mm</p>
    <p>I think you're goddamn lyin'</p>
    <p>I wasn't born yesterday</p>
    <p>I wasn't born anyway</p>
    <p>I cried when you went away</p>
    <p>I think you're goddamn lyin'</p>
    <p>I wasn't born yesterday</p>
    <p>I wasn't born anyway</p>
    <p>I cried when you went away</p>
    <p>I think you're goddamn lyin'</p>

    <p>It gets so bright, I disappear</p>
    <p>It's been twelve nights and a million years</p>
    <p>That weight gets heavy when I'm breathing</p>
    <p>You gave me something to believe in</p>
   
    </section>
      
      <section>
         <p>You said it happened for a reason</p>
    <p>I swear to God, I think you're goddamn lying</p>
    <p>Those little things, I should've said out loud, I would—</p>
    <p>All those little things</p>
    <p>That weigh heavy on the clouds</p>
    <p>I had just a hint of doubt</p>
    <p>I wish I let that hint become me</p>
    <p>Just a little doubt, uh</p>
    <p>Couldn't figure out how to outrun me</p>
    <p>And I'd be free if I just saved the date</p>
    <p>I'd be there with you right now</p>
    <p>And that day plan should've stayed delayed</p>
    <p>'Cause the only thing I want is out</p>
    <p>And it's all those little things</p>
    <p>I should've said out loud</p>
    <p>Every little thing</p>
    <p>I did to make you proud</p>
