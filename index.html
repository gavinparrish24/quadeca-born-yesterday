    I wasn't born yesterday
    I think you're goddamn lyin'
    I wasn't born yesterday (Uh)
    I think you're goddamn lyin'
    I wasn't born yesterday (Oh)
    I wasn't born anyway (Oh)
    I laughed when you went away (Oh)
    I think you're goddamn lyin' (To me)

    <section>
    You want her, you need her
    And yet, you don't believe her (To me)
    You want her, you need her (To me)
    And yet, you don't believe her (To me)
    You want her, you need her
    She no longer needs you, you, you (To me)
    You want her, you need her
    She no longer needs you, you, you

    (I wasn't born yesterday)
    You said I'm in a bettеr place (Oh)
    I got a new birthday to celеbrate (I wasn't born anyway)
    Those candles that you couldn't light (Oh)
    You threw them out and you wondered why (I cried when you went away)
    Don't know why I blew them out for me (Oh)
    Until I forgot how to breathe (I think you're goddamn lying)
    I popped a vein and I made a wish
    I made a wish that'll never be
    </section>
    
    <section>
    Now I'm here, mm
    I've been in so many tears, I try my best not to count it 
    I've been in so many hearts, I've been in so many prayers 
    I've been in so many couches
    I've been in so many lies, I've lived so many lives
    I've lived in so many houses
    I've been subject to change, I keep circlin' dates, I keep thinking about it
    Uh, I've been trying to unsee how you moved on from me
    'Cause it feels like without me
    I've been ripped from the floor, that umbilical cord is still sort of around me
    </section>

    I wasn't born yesterday, mm
    I think you're goddamn lyin', mm
    I wasn't born yesterday, mm, mm
    I think you're goddamn lyin' (To me)
    I wasn't born yesterday (Oh)
    I wasn't born anyway (Oh, to me)
    I cried when you went away (Oh)
    I think you're goddamn lyin' (To me)
    I wasn't born yesterday (Oh)
    I wasn't born anyway (Oh)
    (And yet you don't believe her)
    I cried when you went away (Oh)
    (She no longer needs you, you, you)
    I think you're goddamn lyin' (You, you, you)

    (I wasn't born yesterday)
    It gets so bright, I disappear
    It's been twelve nights and a million years (I wasn't born anyway, oh)
    That weight gets heavy when I'm breathing
    You gave me something to believe in (I cried when you went away)
    You said it happened for a reason (Oh)
    I swear to God, I think you're goddamn lying (To me)
    </section>
      
      <section>
        (You want her, you need her)
    Those little things, I should've said out loud, I would—
    All those little things
    That weigh heavy on the clouds
    I had just a hint of doubt
    I wish I let that hint become me
    Just a little doubt, uh
    Couldn't figure out how to outrun me
    And I'd be free if I just saved the date
    I'd be there with you right now
    And that day plan should've stayed delayed
    'Cause the only thing I want is out
    And it's all those little things
    I should've said out loud
    Every little thing
    I did to make you proud

    (I wasn't born yesterday)
    (I think you're goddamn lyin')
    (I wasn't born yesterday)
    She no longer needs you, you, you
    (I think you're goddamn lyin')
    You, you, you (To me)
    You, you, you
    (I wasn't born yesterday)
    You want her, you need her (Oh)
    And yet, you don't believe her
    (I wasn't born anyway, oh)
    She no longer needs you, you, you
    (I cried when you went away, oh)
    You, you, you
    (I think you're goddamn lyin')
    She no longer needs you, you, you
    You, you, you
